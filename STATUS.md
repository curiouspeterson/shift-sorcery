## Scheduling Logic Details

### Schedule Generation Process
1. **Initialization**
   - Start with an empty week schedule
   - Load all employee availability data
   - Load shift requirements for each time period
   - Initialize tracking systems for weekly hours and daily assignments

2. **Weekly Schedule Generation**
   - Maximum of 5 attempts to generate a valid schedule
   - Each attempt starts fresh with no assignments
   - Must successfully schedule all 7 days to be valid

3. **Daily Schedule Generation**
   - Process each shift type in order: Early Day, Day, Swing, Graveyard
   - For each shift type:
     - Determine required staff count
     - Find all available employees not yet assigned that day
     - Randomly select from available employees to prevent bias
     - Check employee weekly hours before assignment
     - Continue until minimum staff requirement is met

4. **Assignment Rules**
   - Employees cannot work more than one shift per day
   - Weekly hours cannot exceed 40 hours
   - Employees must have declared availability for the shift
   - All shift requirements must be met before moving to next day

5. **Validation Checks**
   - Verify minimum staffing requirements are met for each shift
   - Ensure no employee exceeds daily or weekly limits
   - Confirm all assignments match employee availability
   - Check that shift distribution is balanced

### Current Scheduling Constants
- Maximum scheduling attempts: 5
- Maximum weekly hours: 40 hours
- Maximum employees per shift: 12
- Minimum weekly hours target: 32 hours

## Known Issues and Incomplete Features

### Schedule Generation Issues
- ⚠️ Auto-scheduling algorithm sometimes assigns more employees than required to certain shifts
- ⚠️ Some shifts may be under-staffed while others are over-staffed
- ⚠️ Need to improve distribution of employees across different shift types
- ⚠️ Schedule generation may fail if employee availability is too restrictive
- ⚠️ Random selection of employees might lead to uneven distribution of shifts

### Missing Features
- ❌ Shift swapping between employees
- ❌ Automated notifications for schedule changes
- ❌ Mobile app version
- ❌ Export schedules to PDF/Excel
- ❌ Integration with payroll systems
- ❌ Advanced reporting and analytics

### UI/UX Improvements Needed
- 📝 Mobile responsiveness could be enhanced
- 📝 Better visual feedback for schedule conflicts
- 📝 More intuitive navigation between different views
- 📝 Enhanced calendar interactions

## Upcoming Development Priorities
1. Fix scheduling algorithm to properly respect minimum staffing requirements
2. Implement proper shift distribution logic
3. Add better logging and debugging tools for schedule generation
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback
5. Improve mobile responsiveness
6. Add weighted employee selection based on hours worked
7. Implement shift preference system
8. Add schedule quality metrics

## Technical Debt
- Refactor large components (ScheduleControls.tsx, ScheduleCalendar.tsx)
- Improve type safety across the application
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Implement better state management patterns
- Add more comprehensive testing

## Database Structure
- All necessary tables are in place
- RLS policies are properly configured
- Some tables might need additional indexes for performance

## Security
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) implemented
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Secure authentication flow
- ✅ Protected API endpoints
